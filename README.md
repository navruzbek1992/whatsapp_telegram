## Send whatsapp data through  telegram 

Simple script downloads data from whatsapp and sends to telegram channel/group.

Also user should get telegram api keys from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org/auth).

### Installing

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Pyautogui needs pictures of whatsapp's button. 
User can make exact copy of pics by using PrintScreen key.

Example png files are shown in the repo. 
Since user's screen size is different and pautogui finds keys pixel by pixel.

User does not need use mouse for some time. Pyautogui takes control of mouse and downloads data from whatsapp.
